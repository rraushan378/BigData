1. Create DataFrames by using ddl 

Given the data sets of json as well as csv , how will you read it as a ddl and by not inferring schema

Datasets : 

	Customer.json
	web_sales.csv

2. How will you inferschema while reading the dataset using struct field 

3. Dataframe manipulation 
Cast address_id to longtype
cast birthdate to stringtype

Select demographics.income_range[0] by casting it to double and take alias name as lowerBound and select address_id by casting it to string

find the column size of the customer dataframe

Add a column fullname to customerDF by giving "address_id + 1"


4. Select "ws_order_number","ws_item_sk",  "ws_quantity","ws_net_paid", "ws_net_profit","ws_wholesale_cost" in a new dataframe called as salesStatDf
from webSalesDf which comes from web_sales.csv 

5. Add columns to salesStatDf
	expected_net_paid as ws_quantity*ws_wholesale_cost
	calculated_profit as ws_net_paid-expected_net_paid
	unit_price as ws_wholesale_cost / ws_quantity
	rounded_unitPrice as unit_price rounded up to 2
	brounded_unitPrice as brounded_unitPrice brounded up to 3

6. Add columns to df - customerDf
by renaming "email_address"to "mail"
Adding "developer_site" column by giving default value as insightahead.com"
drop birth_country and address_id columns
and filter dayofmonth in birthdate < 20 from the customerDf


7. Create df filtered from  customerDf by having condition year(birthdate) > 1980 and month as january and day of birthdate > 15 and birth_country is not UNITED STATES,
And select the firstname,lastname,birthdate,birth_country


8.Create dataframe with columns id,name with id as no in the week and the corresponding day 

Ex : 1 -> Monday
	...
	...
     7 -> Sunday

9. From CustomerDF select salutation column count with null

10.  From CustomerDF select salutation column count with not null

11. Drop with 2 types-> all and any 

12. How to fill na element with the below 

"salutation" -> "UNKNOWN",
"firstname" -> "John",
 "lastname" -> "Doe", 
"birthyear" -> 9999

13. Sort customerDF -> firstname,lastname in desc

14 . Find the behavior of customerPurchase from the above mentioned dattaframe

15 . CustomerPurchases grouped on customer_id and aggregate on count(item_id)

16 Aggregate on ws_sales_price 
min,max,avg,mean,count

17. Describe,summary,printShcmea on dataframework
 	
18. Join customerDf,addressDf based on address_id , get matching data by inner join

19,join customerDf,webSalesDf where customer is not null
